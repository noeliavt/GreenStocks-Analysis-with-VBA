## 3. Summary
### 3.1 What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
The purpose of code refactoring is to improve the design of existing code, and it has the following advantages and disadvantages:
### Advantages:
 * Simplified support and code updates.
 * Saved time and money in the future.
 * Reduced complexity for easier understanding
 * Maintainability and scalability

### Disadvantages:
  * Imprecise refactoring could introduce new bugs and errors into the code
  * Run out of time and money
  * Need more testing 

### 3.2.How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
These pros are applied because it allows the script to work with a large amount of data , because it has reduced the complexity, making the code the code more easy to understand it.
One of the cons could be since we are working with a large amount of data, we need to test more in order to get accurate results.
